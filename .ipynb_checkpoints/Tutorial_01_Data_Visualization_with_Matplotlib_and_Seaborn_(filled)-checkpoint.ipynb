    "## Overview of Seaborn's Plotting Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn organizes plotting functions into __modules__ of functions that achieve similar visualization goals through different means. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used modules are _relational_ (for visualizing statistical relationships), _distributional_ (for visualizing distributions), and _categorical_ (for visualizing categorical data). Other than these, there are also _regression_ plots and _matrix_ plots, as listed in the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html#function-interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these modules, there is a cross-cutting classification of seaborn functions as “axes-level” or “figure-level”. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Axes-level__ functions make self-contained plots. They act like drop-in replacements for matplotlib functions, plotting data onto a single ```matplotlib.pyplot.Axes``` object. While they add axis labels and legends automatically, they don’t modify anything beyond the axes that they are drawn into.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, __figure-level__ functions interface with Matplotlib through a Seaborn object, usually a `FacetGrid`, that manages the figure. Because these functions \"own\" their own figure, they can implement features such as putting the legend outside of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module has a single figure-level function, which offers a unitary interface to its various axes-level functions. The high-level view as available on the tutorial website is:\n",
